Project Description: As noted in the song_generator.py file documentation, the goal of this project is to use code
    to generate music. More specifically, to use in this case EarSketch to compose a relaxing song. Rather than compose
    each note and chord, this projects aims to use a set of loops and a given set of parameters to make a song that goes
    beyond simple repetition.

How to Run: While this scripts in the song_generator.py file are written in Python, they utilize methods and variables
    exclusive to EarSketch's systme and thus the program must be run at https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/. To run
    the program, follow the link and paste the entire body of the song_generator.py file into the EarSketch Code Editor. 
    Next, press the green "Run" button to generate and play a song. The song will different each time the program is run.

Project Reflection: While I am proud of the songs that my program generates, I do not beleive they fully fall into the
    category of "relaxing." There are a few reasons for this. First of all, as it is clear in my brainstorm, I orgionally
    planned to use Sonic Pi to generate my music, but the program was unable to worok properly on my system, so EarSketch was
    used as an alternative. While still boasting many features, EarSketch unfortunately does not allow you to code specific
    notes or use certain instruments, and instead forces the user to rely on a somewhat limited library of pre-recorded loops.
    While I planned to write my own chords and music, the outcome through EarSketch is less than ideal. EarSketch's sound
    library does not contain many relaxing beats, and coupled with my novice level understanding of music and mixing, I was
    unable to a program that creates relaxing songs that are smooth and whole. I spent a great deal of time leanring how EarSketch's
    system worked, how to add certain effects, and experiment. Addtiionally, working only from these loops made it challenging to have
    clear, smooth sound at a low temp desired of a relaxing song. Most of the loops I could find were meant for much faster tempos
    and thus the song lacks a certain polished sound. While I wish I had the oppurutnity to use Sonic Pi's more desirable
    functionality to compose notes and chords, I still enjoyed learning this other new program and am pleased with the music my
    scripts create.
